Hi Stuart,

you get a kernel oops when attaching the slc0 ??
This is *really* new to me. Can you post the kernel output for that case?

&gt;<i>    The procedure seems to work most times is:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> # screen /dev/ttyUSB0 115200
</I>&gt;<i> S8
</I>&gt;<i> O
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (then get out of screen with ^A,K,y)
</I>&gt;<i> # slcan_attach /dev/ttyUSB0
</I>&gt;<i> # ifconfig slc0 up
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>
Please try the new slcan_attach with is in the current SVN.

You can attach the device without a separate application like screen or 
minicom now:

<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/socketcan-users">hartko at vwagwolkf320</A>:~/net-next-2.6$ slcan_attach

Usage: slcan_attach [options] tty

Options: -o (send open command 'O\r')
-c (send close command 'C\r')
-s &lt;speed&gt; (set CAN speed 0..8)
-b &lt;btr&gt; (set bit time register value)
-d (only detach line discipline)
-w (attach - wait for keypess - detach)

Examples:
slcan_attach -w -o -s6 -c /dev/ttyS1
slcan_attach /dev/ttyS1
slcan_attach -d /dev/ttyS1


&gt;<i>    Although not every time -- sometimes I get told there's &quot;no such  
</I>&gt;<i> device&quot; when I try to bring the interface up (slc0 exists though)...  
</I>&gt;<i> nothing shows up in dmesg other than the fact that slcan was loaded.
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>
Hm - maybe when you atttach the slc0 under heavy load it may last some 
time until slc0 get's registered ... this should be better with the new 
slcan_attach also.

&gt;<i>    Given the FTDI chip in these CAN devices, has a faster mode, I was  
</I>&gt;<i> wondering if there was some means of writing a userspace CAN driver  
</I>&gt;<i> (using libftdi; which I can get working trivially, and works  
</I>&gt;<i> reliably[1]) and then getting that to hook into the SocketCAN  
</I>&gt;<i> framework using a TUN/TAP-like device.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>
This is an interesting idea but i expect this approach to have a 
performance impact as you need to copy the frames into userspace, parse 
and convert them, and then push them back to kernelspace.

&gt;<i>    Alternatively, would it be better to look at libftdi, and write a  
</I>&gt;<i> kernel-side equivalent that'll allow better control of these devices?
</I>
I won't bet that you can find any 'better control' inside libftdi ... 
but if you find something please let us know.

The approach to use a line discipline for CANUSB and to switch the i/o 
stream to the netdevice like you know it from your modem using SLIP is 
the correct way to handle this.

If you get an oops when attaching the slc0 this has to be fixed. The 
process of the input stream is quite easy to understand and looks really 
solid to me. I wonder if our problems with slcan result in slcan.c or in 
the serial tty stuff. Maybe i need to cook a real patch for the slcan 
driver to let Alan Cox take a look on it (with some attached kernel 
oopses) - or we need to investigate how the pppd does his job when 
switching the line discipline to the slip0 and back ...

&gt;<i>    
</I>&gt;<i> What are peoples' thoughts here?
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>
Yeah. Anyone else?


Regards,
Oliver
