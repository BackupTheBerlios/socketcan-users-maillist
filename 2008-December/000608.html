Thanks.


&gt;&gt;<i> Examples:

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> slcan_attach /dev/ttyS1
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> slcan_attach -d /dev/ttyS1

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yeah, I had difficulties using this... using &quot;-w -o -s8 -c&quot; seemed to

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>
Hm - using it without -w and -c should be similar to the invocation of a 
'bare' slcan_attach that also closes the tty file descriptor after 
switching the line discipline.

Unfortunately i don't have my CANUSB at home right now so i can't test it.

&gt;<i> 	I'm using SVN HEAD as of 2 days ago... there's a cloned

</I>&gt;<i> allows one to install the manpages... even though many are dummy files.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>
Hm ... my lovely TODO list ... 8-]

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>   Although not every time -- sometimes I get told there's &quot;no such  device&quot; 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> when I try to bring the interface up (slc0 exists though)...  nothing shows up 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> in dmesg other than the fact that slcan was loaded.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>       
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Hm - maybe when you atttach the slc0 under heavy load it may last some time 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> until slc0 get's registered ... this should be better with the new slcan_attach 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> also.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 	Hmmm, the machine in question is a Pentium II 300MHz machine...
</I>&gt;<i> not heavily loaded for the most part.  The CAN bus runs at about 2% load
</I>&gt;<i> according to the tools in SocketCAN (when they work).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>
The CAN busload tool calculates the load on the used bits of the 
received frames on the bus at a specific CAN bitrate. 2% is not that 
much indeed. You can also look into /proc/net/can/stats to get a feeling 
on the frame rates processed by the PF_CAN core.

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>   Given the FTDI chip in these CAN devices, has a faster mode, I was  
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> wondering if there was some means of writing a userspace CAN driver  (using 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> libftdi; which I can get working trivially, and works  reliably[1]) and then 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> getting that to hook into the SocketCAN  framework using a TUN/TAP-like 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> device.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>       
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This is an interesting idea but i expect this approach to have a performance 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> impact as you need to copy the frames into userspace, parse and convert them, 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and then push them back to kernelspace.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 	Agreed, this would incurr an overhead... but could we do that
</I>&gt;<i> faster than the 115.2Kbps bitrate that RS232 forces us to?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>
I'm not sure, if the setting of the RS232 bitrate has a real impact to 
the connection between the ftdi-chip and the 'CAN2ASCII' chip behind the 
ftdi?!? This connection can always run at 1MBit/s or above as it is just 
an internal link that is independent from the CAN bitrate. How should 
the 'CAN2ASCII' chip be able to determine the speed when it would be 
variable?

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>   Alternatively, would it be better to look at libftdi, and write a  
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> kernel-side equivalent that'll allow better control of these devices?
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>       
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I won't bet that you can find any 'better control' inside libftdi ... but if 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> you find something please let us know.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The approach to use a line discipline for CANUSB and to switch the i/o stream 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to the netdevice like you know it from your modem using SLIP is the correct way 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to handle this.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If you get an oops when attaching the slc0 this has to be fixed. The process of 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the input stream is quite easy to understand and looks really solid to me. I 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> wonder if our problems with slcan result in slcan.c or in the serial tty stuff. 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Maybe i need to cook a real patch for the slcan driver to let Alan Cox take a

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the pppd does his job when switching the line discipline to the slip0 and back 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ...
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 	Yeah, the ppp driver seems to handle this well, so would definitely
</I>&gt;<i> be a good starting point.  My idea though is to try and drive the FTDI chip
</I>&gt;<i> in its high-speed mode... not sure exactly how to achieve it, but I know
</I>&gt;<i> this other mode does exist, and there's a means to access it via
</I>&gt;<i> libftdi, thus I figure this might have some advantages, one being an
</I>&gt;<i> ability to handle a more conjested high-speed CAN bus without filtering.
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>
Maybe strace shows how this high speed mode is enabled by libftdi - if 
the ftdi chip speed can be set actually. But this would make it visible :-)
