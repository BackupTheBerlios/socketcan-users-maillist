<PRE>Hi all,
    I'm fairly new to SocketCAN, having gotten familiar with using CAN  
via Lawicel's Win32 drivers, and in hardware on some small  
MSP430-based MCUs.

    I'm currently trying to get an application working on top of  
SocketCAN, as I figure it'll give us a reasonable amount of  
portability... however I'm finding that using the Lawicel USB CAN  
devices, one must be particularly careful when attaching and  
detaching, and this is becoming a major problem.

    At the moment, I'm driving the CAN devices using the slcan driver,  
which, when it works, works quite well.  I understand reading the  
documentation for these devices, that using them in the pseudo RS232  
mode has some inefficiencies due to the slowness of the serial link  
(max 115200bps).  The biggest problem however has been stability.

   slcan_attach appears at first to provide a means to automatically  
set the speed (1Mbps; S8 in our case) and open the CAN channel before  
attaching it to slc0.  However, this doesn't appear to work very  
well... maybe I'm doing it wrong, but more frequently than not, a  
kernel bug is triggered, and the machine has to be rebooted before I  
can do any work.  (root logins seize up...etc.)

   The procedure seems to work most times is:

# screen /dev/ttyUSB0 115200
S8
O

(then get out of screen with ^A,K,y)
# slcan_attach /dev/ttyUSB0
# ifconfig slc0 up

   Although not every time -- sometimes I get told there's &quot;no such  
device&quot; when I try to bring the interface up (slc0 exists though)...  
nothing shows up in dmesg other than the fact that slcan was loaded.

   Given the FTDI chip in these CAN devices, has a faster mode, I was  
wondering if there was some means of writing a userspace CAN driver  
(using libftdi; which I can get working trivially, and works  
reliably[1]) and then getting that to hook into the SocketCAN  
framework using a TUN/TAP-like device.

   Alternatively, would it be better to look at libftdi, and write a  
kernel-side equivalent that'll allow better control of these devices?   
What are peoples' thoughts here?

I haven't lost my mind...
   ...it's backed up on a tape somewhere.

1. On the Lawicel site, they give an example driver for Linux using  
some proprietary lib... but using that example, and libftdi, you can  
write your own driver.  Evidently, the protocol used via this other  
means is identical to that used over RS232.
