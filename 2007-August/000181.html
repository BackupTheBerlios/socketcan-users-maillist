Hi Rodolfo,

if you could look at the SVN log you will see all our changes based on
hints and advises from the netdev list and from every change the inside
kernel since our first posting
(<A HREF="http://marc.info/?l=linux-netdev&amp;m=117932884006029&amp;w=2">http://marc.info/?l=linux-netdev&amp;m=117932884006029&amp;w=2</A>) that was
already quickly reviewed by Thomas Gleixner. Indeed we've done all the
things that have been requested.

The problem is, that there are many misunderstandings as CAN is very
different to the other networking stuff and you have to go a bit deeper
to understand the broken CAN design in opposite to Ethernet and IP. And
there was also a misunderstanding with my wish to include the  PF_CAN
core first and not to wait for the suggested changes in the VCAN driver
(as the protocol family and the netdriver are really _different_
things!). Finally this RFC to Partick (
<A HREF="http://marc.info/?l=linux-netdev&amp;m=118460167525654&amp;w=2">http://marc.info/?l=linux-netdev&amp;m=118460167525654&amp;w=2</A> ) waits to be
answered since 17 days ... i made some changes in the comments today to
point out the intention more precisely, which might (hopefully) make
this RFC to Patrick obsolete ...

Btw. everything that has to be fixed and beautified is done now, as we
*really* adopted the hints. But David is (due to all these
misunderstandings) on edge - which i can understand in parts.

AFAIK Urs want's to post the patch series try#4 this evening which is
try#3 (<A HREF="http://marc.info/?l=linux-netdev&amp;m=118248490902398&amp;w=2">http://marc.info/?l=linux-netdev&amp;m=118248490902398&amp;w=2</A>) with some
changes described in
(<A HREF="http://marc.info/?l=linux-netdev&amp;m=118398142013357&amp;w=2">http://marc.info/?l=linux-netdev&amp;m=118398142013357&amp;w=2</A>) and some
changes caused by the ongoing kernel development.

If you have still any questions on PF_CAN or it's concepts please try to
discuss them here first (as i don't want to make the netdev ML
discussions even more curious in these critical times ;-) You can find a
full qualified documentation under
<A HREF="http://svn.berlios.de/svnroot/repos/socketcan/trunk/kernel/2.6/Documentation/networking/can.txt">http://svn.berlios.de/svnroot/repos/socketcan/trunk/kernel/2.6/Documentation/networking/can.txt</A>

Thanks for your interest &amp; activity!

Best Regards,
Oliver
