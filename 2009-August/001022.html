<PRE>Dear SocketCAN users and developers,

as the new netlink configuration interface for CAN network device drivers
becomes part of Linux 2.6.31, we're closing the development on the previously
created netlink branch in the SVN.

To all of you that did not follow the whole development between rev974 and
rev1037, here is a short summary:

- new ISA, IOMEM and platform drivers for SJA1000 and CC770 (formerly i82527)
that should be able to replace the drivers in drivers/net/can/old/...

- added driver for ESD 331 CAN interfaces

- support 4 channels on EMS CPC-104M and CPC-PCI CAN interfaces

- several improvements and clean-ups in at91_can, softing and ems_pcmcia

- and of course: The netlink configuration interface provided by Wolfgang

To resolve the compilation issues for out-of-tree (kernel-tree) compilation
the source code in the SVN now includes

    include/socketcan/can.h ...

instead of

    include/linux/can.h ...

With this change we can maintain version depended include files (down to
2.6.15) without conflicting with your current development environment and
currently used kernel.

To extract the kernel source code in the SVN for creating patches the tool
strip-src has been enhanced to replace include/socketcan with include/linux.

&gt;<i> Note that you can use
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  ./strip-src -m -i -v 2.6.31 kernel/2.6/drivers/net/can/at91_can.c
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> to get a reasonable file version for kernel inclusion.
</I>
The plan for the SVN is to maintain a solution for CAN support in older
Kernels. Whenever a new driver is mature for kernel inclusion the main
development of that driver is continued in Linux mainline.

If possible the maintainers should keep an eye on fixes that have been applied
to the mainline, so that the SVN remains somehow up-to-date for people that
need to use older kernels.

Many thanks to Wolfgang Grandegger who has driven the CAN driver interface
together with the configuration interface. Also many thanks to all the other
guys out there for the contribution and the feedback that made it possible to
select 'real' CAN hardware drivers in the 2.6.31 menuconfig :-)

</PRE>
