<PRE>My Socket CAN is working! Thanks you for GREAT assistance, Here are a
couple notes for any other newbies...

1) &quot;ifconfig can0 up&quot; (and/or can1, etc)
Do this to start the can interface. Confirm it is up via ifconfig. This
is obvious, but I didn't think about it at all until Oliver asked me to
run ifconfig.

2) make sure the datarate on your bus mathches what the interface
expects. 

In my case, my other devices on the bus are at 250kbs, so the default
500kbs that gets assigned in dev.c doesn't work for me. It looks like an
ioctl will fix that up, but as I was getting it working I hacked-in a
default of 250kbs.

Thanks again to Wolfgang and Oliver! Also thanks to all contributors.
This socket API for CAN is great!

-Mike

Both should work.

&gt;<i> Both produce a clean build. Once loaded, I run &quot;cansniffer any&quot;, and

</I>
Hm, well, yes, the syntax seems to have changed recently:

   # ./candump any,0:0,#ffff
   can0  123  [3] AB CD EF
   can1  123  [3] AB CD EF
   can1  20000004  [8] 00 08 00 00 00 00 00 00   ERRORFRAME
   can1  20000004  [8] 00 10 00 00 00 00 00 00   ERRORFRAME

&gt;<i> At this point I don't see any screen output. I'm expecting some

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So far I have confirmed my gpio port_config looks correct (CAN on

&gt;<i> and I do have the lite5200 mscan nodes in my device tree.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not seeing any errors or warnings on load. Could it be that this
</I>is
&gt;<i> actually, &quot;working&quot; and that I'm just too dumb to know what utility to

</I>
When you the MSCAN module is loaded, you should find in your kernel log:

  mpc52xx-mscan mpc52xx-mscan.0: probe for port 0xC9074900 done
(irq=145)
  mpc52xx-mscan mpc52xx-mscan.1: probe for port 0xC9076980 done
(irq=146)

If not, then most likely the MSCAN nodes are still missing in your FDT 
blob. There should be the following directories on your system:

   /sys/devices/f0000000.soc5200/f0000900.mscan/
   /sys/devices/f0000000.soc5200/f0000980.mscan/

&gt;<i> What are the interface names to use for CAN1 and CAN2 on the mpc5200?
</I>So
&gt;<i> far I'm asking for, &quot;any&quot;. I tried 0, 1, 2, mscan, etc but cansniffer
</I>&gt;<i> doesn't like any of these. It's not yet clear to me after a quick look
</I>&gt;<i> at the source, but I'll keep looking.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Please advise. In the meantime I'm wading through source code and
</I>&gt;<i> inserting some printk's in an attempt to learn how all this works so
</I>&gt;<i> that I can see some action on the CAN interface.
</I>
I have it working here with 2.6.24.7 on my TQM5200 module.

Wolfgang.
