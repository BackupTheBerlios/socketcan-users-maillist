Now i tried. And indeed i also saw the reordered CAN frames on vcan's.

I was working with

 cangen -g 0 vcan0 -v -v -I 0 -L 4 -D i &gt; cangen.out

 candump -r 1000000 vcan0 &gt; candump.out

and

 diff cangen.out candump.out

which produces a similar behaviour.

But i do not see this problem with a little delay on sending the frames, e.g. with

 cangen -g 1 vcan0 -v -v -I 0 -L 4 -D i &gt; cangen.out

I assume this problem to appear due to the Kernel scheduling, as the sending
of a frame via vcan causes a direct feedback to the socket receive buffer for
the socket that has subscribed the data. And under maximum load the scheduling
seems to reorder the packets under circumstances. And when the receiving
application is not able to handle the incoming CAN frames they are
additionally dropped.

This is also caused by the scheduler, as both the producer and receiver of CAN
frames are trying to use the CPU at it's maximum - which obviously leads to
reordering and packet drops sometimes. IMHO this is a border case that can
only be archived with software devices like the vcan or the loopback device
(lo), which we could try also to check it's behaviour in these border cases.

Do you have a real use-case to handle more than 80.000 frames/s on a single
vcan or was it an academical question?

Of course i would be very interested why and where the reorders take happen.

Regards,
Oliver
