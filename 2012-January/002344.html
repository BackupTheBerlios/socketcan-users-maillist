<PRE>Hi!

2012/1/10 Sebastian Haas &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/socketcan-users">dev at sebastianhaas.info</A>&gt;:

&gt;<i> That looks quite interesting. The approach is different than mine, as the
</I>&gt;<i> logic in restcan is at the server side and the client (not yet available) is
</I>&gt;<i> an optional visualization/control component.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It is quite difficult to find active open source projects which are CAN
</I>&gt;<i> related. I hope to find some help to implement the visualization for
</I>&gt;<i> restcan. Too bad Kayak does the signal processing on its own.
</I>
I agree that the approaches are quite different and also we are trying
to cover different use cases with our projects. With Kayak I tried to
provide a free CAN bus analysis solution. The TCP/IP abstraction is a
nice feature which enables you to do things like remote analysis and
to connect from multiple machines at once.
Kayak is not - and will probably never be - a very good tool for
restbus simulation. In principle it is possible but Kayak is not
intended for this.

&gt;&gt;<i> Implementing a restbus functionality in JAVA based on the Kajak library is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> very easy - when &#160;you are a JAVA developer ;-)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I like your approach to get a restbus simulation in C.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Well the simulation is written in Javascript, which is even easier than C or
</I>&gt;<i> Java. I want it to be easy to use. The only dependency is NodeJS and you can
</I>&gt;<i> write and run simulation and test cases from commandline within few minutes.
</I>
I like the idea of using Javascript and especially NodeJS for restbus
simulation. At the weekend I will try to set it up at home and play
around a little bit :).

&gt;&gt;<i> I wonder, if it makes sense for your project to adopt the XML-based KCD
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> format for CAN signal descriptions:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I had a look at the spec, KCD looks pretty good, I think I will use it to
</I>&gt;<i> replace the JSON description.
</I>
\o/ Yay! That's a good idea.

&gt;&gt;<i> There's also a dbc input converter on the run to create KCDs:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://github.com/dschanoeh/CANBabel">https://github.com/dschanoeh/CANBabel</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thats create, I was afraid I need to implement the converter myself. ;-) I
</I>&gt;<i> hope they will extend to parse .sym files from Peak as well.
</I>
We mostly have .dbc files we need to convert. Support for different
formats (and possibly even conversion in both ways) is planned. Do you
use PEAK .sym-files and could you provide some example files and help
finding bugs in a .sym-Parser?

&gt;<i> Do you know about BUSMASTER (<A HREF="https://github.com/rbei-etas/busmaster">https://github.com/rbei-etas/busmaster</A>). If it
</I>&gt;<i> weren't Windows (R) only it would be an interesting solution.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Oliver, what must restcan provide to be useable for you in your daily work?
</I>&gt;<i> Or what do you expect from such a tool?
</I>
How lightweight is NodeJS? I would find this useful for quick and
dirty hacks in embedded units. Could memory (Flash and RAM) be a
problem on such devices?

Greetings,
Jan
