Hi Michal and Pavel,

thanks for this benchmark!


&gt;<i> The main goal of this work was to find whether and how socketcan's
</I>&gt;<i> integration with Linux networking layer influences negatively
</I>&gt;<i> communication latencies.
</I>

I did some benchmarks with a 2.6.30 LTTng Kernel some weeks ago. But i did not
add any (remarkable) Ethernet traffic to check that influence also. Good idea.


&gt;<i> The results is, in brief, that there is some
</I>&gt;<i> impact, but still socketcan it is suitable for most of our CAN-related
</I>&gt;<i> projects.
</I>

Very good. This was also my conclusion.


&gt;<i> The testbed was a Pentium 4 box with a Kvaser quad-head PCI card
</I>&gt;<i> (SJA1000 based). We have simply connected output 1 to output 2 and
</I>&gt;<i> measured the time how long it takes for the message to go forth and
</I>&gt;<i> back.
</I>

The idea behind my setup was to benchmark the chardev vs netdev in general.
For that reason, i used a PEAK PCMCIA card (which had an exclusive IRQ line)
and compiled the same driver with and without netdev support:

make KERNEL LOCATION=/home/hartko/linux-2.6-lttng NET=NETDEV SUPPORT
make KERNEL LOCATION=/home/hartko/linux-2.6-lttng NET=NO NETDEV SUPPORT

As i only wanted to measure the receive path timings with a moderate CAN
traffic source, i activated these markers in LTTng:

chardev:
C1 /mnt/debugfs/ltt/markers/kernel/irq entry/enable
C2 /mnt/debugfs/ltt/markers/fs/ioctl/enable

netdev:
N1 /mnt/debugfs/ltt/markers/kernel/irq entry/enable
N2 /mnt/debugfs/ltt/markers/net/dev receive/enable
N3 /mnt/debugfs/ltt/markers/fs/read/enable

In userspace i used 'candump' for SocketCAN and 'receivetest' from PEAK for
the chardev version - as both are finally using copy_to_user() where the
marker is located.

The results:

Measure    Average   min     max    standard deviation
C1 -&gt; C2    112us    67us   188us       22,4us

N1 -&gt; N3     93us    61us   160us        9,8us
N2 -&gt; N3     26us    11us   90us         4,8us
N1 -&gt; N2     67us    54us   92us         7,2us

As the PEAK driver used exactly the same IRQ handler code, i was quite
astonished that the netdev concept was indeed faster than the chardev!

Regarding the much higher standard deviation of the chardev my assuption is
that the FIFO in the chardev driver causes this problem, as the FIFO is filled
in IRQ-context. When the CAN frame is pulled from the FIFO the lock needs to
be irq-safe. On the netdev side the IRQ-context is only to access the
controller registers and to fill the skbuff which is handled in soft-irq
context from there.

Finally the RX path was faster with netdev and the impact of different driver
implementations or the performance of the drivers TX-handling on the SJA1000
was excluded in this benchmark.


&gt;<i> We have used canping [1] tool to generate CAN traffic.
</I>&gt;<i> Canping uses our VCA (virtual CAN API) library, which provides common
</I>&gt;<i> API for different driver back-ends. If somebody feels this tool might
</I>&gt;<i> be useful for socketcan we will simplify it to have no external
</I>&gt;<i> dependencies so that it can be included to socketcan/tools.
</I>

I tried to figure out how canping was used with SocketCAN in your testbed. But
i didn't find any socket() call :-)


&gt;<i> 1.5 2.6.26 virtual driver problem 
</I>&gt;<i> ----------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> According to
</I>&gt;<i> [<A HREF="http://rtime.felk.cvut.cz/can/benchmark/1/by-clck/2400/rtt-virtual/2.6.26-2-686//rtt-virtual.png">http://rtime.felk.cvut.cz/can/benchmark/1/by-clck/2400/rtt-virtual/2.6.26-2-686//rtt-virtual.png</A>],
</I>&gt;<i> under Debian's 2.6.26 kernel, socketcan's virtual driver introduces
</I>&gt;<i> very high delays (0.5 second). We do not have explanation for this.
</I>

I don't have any explanation for this either - when it would be on the 2.6.26
only.

The vcan makes a loopback for the CAN frame in can_send() in af_can.c

So when you write a CAN frame into a raw-socket (e.g. on vcan0) this skb is
directly(!) delivered via several callback functions to the socket receive
buffers of the listening sockets.

When you kick in a bulk of CAN frames, i assume the system to read as much
data as possible (and deliver the skbs) until the stream is torn off e.g. by
scheduling the sender of the data.

And *then* the other applications begin to read the stuff that's probably
quite old (as you can see).

IMO this behaviour depends heavily on the scheduling algorithm of the system,
which may explain this measurement values especially on the 2.6.26 ... ?!?


&gt;<i> 1.6 Kernel 2.6.31-rc7 has very good performance 
</I>&gt;<i> ------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The graphs at
</I>&gt;<i> [<A HREF="http://rtime.felk.cvut.cz/can/benchmark/1/kern-2.6.31-rc7.html">http://rtime.felk.cvut.cz/can/benchmark/1/kern-2.6.31-rc7.html</A>] look
</I>&gt;<i> almost the same as graphs for rt_preempt (-rt) kernels and socketcan
</I>&gt;<i> often perform as fast as Lincan. It seems that there are no relevant
</I>&gt;<i> changes in networking code as well as in socketcan. Therefore we guess
</I>&gt;<i> this might be related to some changes in RCU and socketbuffers.
</I>

Yep!

As from my chardev vs. netdev benchmark i really felt that the network stuff
is always under surveillance of so many people in the world that need the
network stack to be as fast and performant as possible.

So with all this per-cpu locking and other fine granular locking the network
people will always help the CAN stuff to run faster also :-)

Again many thanks for your benchmarks.

If you have some slides for the eleventh Real-Time Linux Workshop i would
highly appreciate if you could send a notification.

Best regards,
Oliver
