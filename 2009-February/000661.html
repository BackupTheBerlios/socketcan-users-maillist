Hi,

&gt;<i> I'm using the mcp251x driver with a PXA270.  It mostly works with the

I guess you are using the mcp2515 because earlier ones just support 5 Mhz.

&gt;<i>  After looking at the signals with a scope, I see that at low clock
</I>&gt;<i> rates it is not de-asserting the SPI frame for multi-byte transactions
</I>&gt;<i> like read.  But as the clock rate goes up, it appears that the frame
</I>&gt;<i> is de-asserted every byte.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
It's not clear to me what do you mean for SPI frame. Only 4 lines are
used for SPI communication with the mcp251x: SI, SO, SCLK and CS. I
guess you mean CS. If this supposition holds it's ok that the line is
held down for all the bytes that compose a command. It *has* to go up
and down only between commands (there is a box warning for this in
section 12.1 of the mcp2515 data sheet). Haven't you just looked at
SSPSFRM instead of the CS line (which is defined in platform data),
have you?

&gt;<i> Any thoughts on the best way to fix this?  One way would be to
</I>&gt;<i> configure 24 bit transactions for read/write instructions, etc, but I
</I>&gt;<i> want to make sure I'm not missing anything.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
one of the benefits of using the mc251x is that you can send all the
bytes of a frame without commands for selecting registers, so you do
less traffic on the spi bus but the spi messages are variable length.
Try to force the mcp2515 as a mcp2510 to disable this feature.

&gt;<i> Looking at the PXA270 SPI controller, it can leave the frame active
</I>&gt;<i> for back-to-back transactions, but you probably need to keep the SPI
</I>&gt;<i> data fed.  At low data rates, this mostly happens, but not at higher
</I>&gt;<i> data rates.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I had a quick look at the pxa2xx SPI driver and it looks quite
complicated since it uses DMA. Are you using DMA mode support for the
mcp251x driver too? Perhaps you should try to ask in spi-devel and
arm-linux-kernel list too if there are some known problems with the
SPI driver. AFAIK CS should be deasserted only between SPI messages. I
think you should define a &quot;cs_control&quot; function that handles CS (grep
for cs_control in arch/arm/mach-pxa for examples) and not try to rely
on SSPSFRM line (as PXA270 data sheet seems to suggest). It looks like
the problem could be on a lower (SPI) level.
