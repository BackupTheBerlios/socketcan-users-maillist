OK. Do you need it int the kernel? Nevertheless, Socket-CAN is already
integrated into the DENX linux-2.6-denx tree but it might not work with
2.6.23, though due to the mentioned modification of the netdev layer. I
did not check for a while.

&gt;<i> But the cleaner way of course would be to change the socketcan project
</I>&gt;<i> and provide a diff to that. Is it okay if I change the socketcan-project
</I>&gt;<i> locally which I got via svn and then provide you with what svn diff
</I>&gt;<i> spits out ? Or how can I provide a better patch ?
</I>
That would be nice, but it would be even better if you could use the
development branch cannetdriver26 with the new CAN device interface.

  $ svn checkout
<A HREF="http://svn.berlios.de/svnroot/repos/socketcan/branches/cannetdriver26">http://svn.berlios.de/svnroot/repos/socketcan/branches/cannetdriver26</A>
  $ cannetdriver26
  $ make ARCH=powerpc KERNELDIR=&lt;your-kernel&gt; \
    CONFIG_CAN_MSCAN=m CONFIG_CAN_MPC52XX=m

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> There can be quite a long list of tx timeouts afterwards, but it will
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> stop after some while.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Hm, do CAN messages get out to the bus?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Generally yes. I have a test program that is communicating to a
</I>&gt;<i> connected IO-unit and sets there a 6 bit output which itself is
</I>&gt;<i> connected to the IO-units input and I read back this value, measure the
</I>&gt;<i> time and compare the IO Input value with the previous set output value.
</I>&gt;<i> The output is set as a binary counter value, which increases and
</I>&gt;<i> decreases. This test more or less works fine all the time.
</I>
OK.

&gt;<i> In the Error scenario I send 64 SDO messages to different CAN-ID's to
</I>&gt;<i> see if there are connected devices on the bus. And then this error
</I>&gt;<i> appears. Because I don't have connected 64 units to the bus I don't know
</I>&gt;<i> yet if all 64 messages are sent to the bus. Maybe it's time for our CAN
</I>&gt;<i> sniffer (or could I use candump for that purpose as well ?).
</I>
The timeout is set to 0.5 seconds in the MSCAN driver:

  #define MSCAN_WATCHDOG_TIMEOUT  ((500*HZ)/1000)

Do you check the return value of send(to)? Be aware that it can return
with errno set to EAGAIN when the TX socket buffer is full.
Nevertheless, the problems seems to show up when you send many messages
in sequence.

&gt;<i> Is there maybe a correlation of how we setup our realtime tasks
</I>&gt;<i> priorities under Preempt-RT and the CAN IRQ (which in my understanding
</I>&gt;<i> will also be scheduled as RT task) ?
</I>
Are you using Preempt-RT already? Then the IRQ is handled by a kernel
thread and priorities do matter. The following ps command should tell
you more:

 ps -eo pid,tid,class,rtprio,ni,pri,psr,pcpu,stat,wchan:14,comm

But I think there is a bug in the MSCAN driver.

Wolfgang.
