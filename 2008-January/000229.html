Yupp. I had to change quite a few things inside the socket-can project
and used mkpatch and afterwards manually removed some incompatibilities
inside the patch (remove include of compat.h,  adding struct
net_device_stats net_stats to dev.h, removing 1st parameter from
get_dev_by_index() ).
But this cleanly applies now to 2.6.23.1 and works at least for the test
programs I am using. The final patch is over 376kb uncompressed or 84kb
compressed. Is this too large as an attachment to the list ?

But the cleaner way of course would be to change the socketcan project
and provide a diff to that. Is it okay if I change the socketcan-project
locally which I got via svn and then provide you with what svn diff
spits out ? Or how can I provide a better patch ?

</I>
Generally yes. I have a test program that is communicating to a
connected IO-unit and sets there a 6 bit output which itself is
connected to the IO-units input and I read back this value, measure the
time and compare the IO Input value with the previous set output value.
The output is set as a binary counter value, which increases and
decreases. This test more or less works fine all the time.

In the Error scenario I send 64 SDO messages to different CAN-ID's to
see if there are connected devices on the bus. And then this error
appears. Because I don't have connected 64 units to the bus I don't know
yet if all 64 messages are sent to the bus. Maybe it's time for our CAN
sniffer (or could I use candump for that purpose as well ?).

Is there maybe a correlation of how we setup our realtime tasks
priorities under Preempt-RT and the CAN IRQ (which in my understanding
will also be scheduled as RT task) ?


Best regards,

Daniel Schnell.
