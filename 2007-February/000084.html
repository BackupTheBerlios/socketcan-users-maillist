</I>&gt;&gt;<i> CANOpen work with socketcan.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks for your very informative mail.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I would gladly receive the socketcan patch for the PEAK driver, as I'm
</I>&gt;<i> finishing my CANopen library, and would like to make it compatible
</I>&gt;<i> with the api.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>I'll send the patched PEAK-driver in a separate mail. To compile the 
patched driver:

1. tar xvzf peak-linux-driver-5.5-netdev-2007-01-09-0915.tar.gz
2. cd peak-linux-driver-5.5-netdev/driver
3. make NET=NETDEV_SUPPORT (*1)
4. insmod ./pcan.ko
5. ./pcan_make_devices 4 (*2)

Please look into /var/log/messages for the PEAK-drivers messages. In 
/proc/pcan you can see your different char-devices and the associated 
netdevice names like 'can0'. In /proc/pcan you can also see the bitrate 
register values now.

*1 = if you're working on a notebook you may add things like ISA=NO 
PCI=NO to omit the compilation of unused HW-types ...

*2 = This creates the chardevice inodes under /dev/pcanXX (if you did 
not do this so far). If you want to change the bitrates, you can do this 
via the described technique from the PEAK documentation, e.g.:

echo &quot;i 0x4914 e&quot; &gt; /dev/pcan32

With &quot; ifconfig can0 up&quot; the interface get's online. If you have a CAN 
source attached you may see the incrementing packet-counters in /proc/pcan .

Assuming you have already compiled the socketcan kernel modules and 
loaded at least can.ko and can-raw.ko you may say  things like &quot;candump 
can0&quot; or &quot;candump -ta any&quot; to see the incoming frames. In /proc/net/can/ 
you may also view the 'stats' file for statistic purposes.

Especially for development i can recommend to use the virtual CAN bus 
driver (vcan.ko). As you can use different applications, candumps, etc. 
at the same time on one (virtual) CAN bus you have an excellent 
development environment here.

&gt;<i> I know about canfestival, but I wanted something simpler, non-threaded
</I>&gt;<i> and non-realtime. What I have right now does most of what a master in
</I>&gt;<i> a small instrumentation network on a Linux desktop / laptop PC needs.
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>
Hm - this sounds interesting. I'm not very familiar with CANopen but 
what i learned from Edouard is, that it may be an interesting approach 
to realize a CANopen protocol inside the kernel inside the protocol 
family CAN. The sockaddr_can address union had to be extended by the 
logical CANopen DeviceID. The addressing tables could be set via 
sockopts then ... just an idea.

&gt;<i> I will also try to clean up the code and make it public soon. Any good
</I>&gt;<i> ideas for free project hosting?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>Using the berlios server for the socketcan project was an idea of Jan 
Kizka (i think). I don't have any additional experiences. Berlios just 
works fine for me, but the OpenFacts Wiki is not that fancy thing in my 
opinion.

Best regards,
Oliver
