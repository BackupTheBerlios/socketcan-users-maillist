Hi Teemu,

indeed Urs and me are currently working on additional documentation and 
man-pages to answer most of the questions that may occur, when the 
concepts of the integration of a Protocol Family CAN (PF_CAN) into the 
kernel are posted on the LKML. The plan is to announce the socketcan 
project on the LKML somewhere in March. I don't know if it's good to 
contact the Maintainers right now, but i am not that experienced in 
these things nowadays. I had my last mail contact to Linus in 1992 due 
to a problem in the serial driver IRQs ;-)

The creation of a common API for CAN in Linux (especially to be used via 
the BSD-Socket API) is the mayor goal of this project. To get an 
overview you may read

<A HREF="http://openfacts.berlios.de/index-en.phtml?title=Socket-CAN">http://openfacts.berlios.de/index-en.phtml?title=Socket-CAN</A>

or this README from Urs

<A HREF="http://svn.berlios.de/svnroot/repos/socketcan/trunk/README">http://svn.berlios.de/svnroot/repos/socketcan/trunk/README</A>

-----------

Regarding your question on the PEAK hardware, i can tell you that the 
next mainline PEAK-driver (<A HREF="http://www.peak-system.com/linux/index.htm">http://www.peak-system.com/linux/index.htm</A>) 
in Version 6.0 will have socketcan netdevice support(!!). I maintained a 
netdevice-patch to the vanilla PEAK-driver for a long time for our 
projects at Volkswagen Group Research. This patch is now integrated into 
the mainline PEAK-driver (on the PEAK-SVN). Currently the Maintainer of 
the PEAK-linux-driver (Klaus Hitschler) is working on the release 
documentation. I assume the Version 6.0 to be released within the next 
2-3 weeks.
The socketcan support is working for *all* available PEAK-hardware (ISA 
/ PC104, PCI, Parport-Dongle, USB, PCCard).

I hope, this information has helped you so far. If it's very urgent for 
your project, i can sent you the my last netdevice patch for the vanilla 
PEAK-driver v5.5. Have you already looked at the CANOpen Implementation 
from Edouard Tisserant at <A HREF="http://canfestival.sf.net">http://canfestival.sf.net</A> ? Edouard knows the 
socketcan project from our meeting at PEAK-systems. Maybe you can 
contact him to share/synchronize the work that needs to be done to make 
CANOpen work with socketcan.

Best regards,
Oliver
