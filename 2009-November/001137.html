Just some notes about the performance issue. I had similar problems on
a system using both a MAX3100 and the MCP2510 (which is worse than
MCP2515) on the same Samsung S3C2440 SPI interface. Unfortunately
hardware designer love SPI peripherals because they are cheap, need a
small number of wires to connect and eat a small number of GPIOs on
the SOC (3 + no. of devices). On the other hand they are not suited
for high speed operations. After some analysis I found the following
culprits of low performance:

1) many architectures offer very low performance SPI master device
drivers especially in the mainline kernel. They are used for really
small transfer of data, for example reading/writing some eeprom chips.
Many times there are just bit-banging type of drivers or use
workqueues.

2) SPI device type drivers often use worqueues. This i for a simple
reason: they could block on every SPI I/O and it's quite tricky to
understand where in the Linux kernel you can block safely (you get the
oops &quot;trying to sleep in an atomic context&quot; quite often if you use SPI
naively calls in kernelspace). The easiest solution is using
workqueues, otherwise one should structure the driver as a state
machine (the kernel doesn't provide cool constructs like coroutines).
The real problem is that workqueues compete on the scheduler as normal
user space process do.

I kind of solved the problems and published the results here:
<A HREF="http://www.evolware.org/chri/paciugo/">http://www.evolware.org/chri/paciugo/</A> because I feel they won't be
suitable for mainline inclusion. Now the system can sustain 115200
serial communication and reasonable CAN traffic without much loss.
Anyway keep in mind that you will never get great results, think about
a chip connected via a local bus for those (pci is even better). For
every byte transfered via SPI you have an interrupt, a small ARM
system starts showing problems with 10000-5000 interrupts per second
in my experience. And, as outlined on the page, DMA is not an option
at least on the platform I used.

That said, it can always be a driver bug, so I'm happy to help you in
doing more tests. I'll try to setup a system for testing myself ASAP.
As Wolfgang said, pay attention to CAN statistics. Hardware RX buffer
overruns and dropped frames due to skb shortage should be correctly
counted in the driver. Check both CAN and ifconfig statistics and
please report them.

HTH,
