<PRE>Hi Wolfgang, 

Thanks for answering my question.  I loaded the latest version of Debian
(yesterday) from their website (using the &quot;live&quot; version and then installing
from that image).  I searched the installation and didn't find sja1000_isa
at all, only sja1000 and sja1000_platform.  I have a 32 bit Atom board and
the Debian installation went normally.  Did I perhaps install the wrong
thing?  Thanks again for your patience!

Fred E.

Why do you think that? The sja1000_isa is still available in the mainline
kernel. And the sja1000_platform driver is not replacing it? It serves a
different bus. Is it possible that you switched to 64bit Linux at the same
time? Older kernel versions do not support sja1000_isa on
x86_64 but the issue has been fixed in the meantime.

Wolfgang.
