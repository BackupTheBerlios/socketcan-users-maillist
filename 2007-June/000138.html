Hm - even when we're currently having only some changes inside the CAN
core that had been caused by detail discussions on the kernel netdev
mailing list, i do not assume to have any issues inside the stuff placed
in linux/net/can/*. If you have some suggestions, ideas or fixes for the
CAN core stuff (af_can.c, raw.c, bcm.c) you should post them NOW.
Changes in linux/drivers/net/can/* are assumed anyway - but this is
device driver stuff and does not primary affect the protocol family PF_CAN.

Btw. the current head (== rev399) is the best socketcan we ever had ;-)
There had been major improvements in kernel lockings and for hot
unplugging of CAN netdevices (e.g. if you hard unplug your PEAK USB
adaptors).

Best regards,
Oliver
