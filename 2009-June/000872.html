Hi Sven,

I know it is possible, I did that for my first time about ten years
ago on Redhat Linux 4.2, and I use SSH pretty much every day. I am
well aware of the principles, but, I could also have been a newbie.
Your comment would not be very useful for me in either case.

Did you read the entire message? The unit is in my car. My car needs
to be running and in a hotspot for me to be able to access is trough
SSH, which in my case means driving around until I find an open wlan.
I live on 8th floor in an apartment building, so my own wlan is not
even remotely close to being available. It is not as if I can just log
on to the computer and hack away freely at any time

So, yes, I can do it from my sofa, but the car need to be running to
not drain the battery, and placed somewhere where there is wlan
access. In essence, this means that someone must be inside the car for
the duration of the job, and in practice, this means me. This also
means that I will not be sitting in my sofa. Also, it is quite costly,
as the gas prices here is around 2 USD per litre, or 8 USD per gallon,
and these things has a tendency to need some manual care (i.e demands
some time) to work (yes, yes, in theory everything works fine). I
could bring my laptop to my car, log on and work from there, but this
is a whole lot of work compared to just running an &quot;apt-get update &amp;&amp;
apt-get upgrade&quot; when I happen to be in an hotspot, which could even
be automated quite easily if I wish.

For a car-pc, I am not willing to have to spend a lot of time with
custom stuff while working on that PC. I can play with stuff on my
laptop, sitting in my sofa, not while sitting in my car. I want the PC
in my car to &quot;just work&quot;. As such, I am not going to use socketcan for
this project, at least not for now. I made a script in yesterday that
does everything I currently want, so for now I am good.

Morgan T&#248;rvolt
