Just my 2 eurocents on this point from a more general view. This
problem is quite common in Linux driver programming, since there are
some context when you just cannot sleep. And there are many subtle
ways how you can find yourself calling some code that does without
knowing it. Unfortunately I had to do some work on other OSes like
windoze ce for a living: there quite everything (only a tiny bit of
code called HAL is different)  is a thread with the same API like
userspace that can block: it's easier to write code but all the
locking issues are on your shoulders. The result is that code quality
(even that released by big companies, I can prove it!) is awful
compared to that of Linux with tons of problems facing now and then
and very difficult to debug. So I think this is good for cell phones
or mp3 players ... who cares if you have to reset them sometimes. But
it's crap for serious use (even if I saw crazy people using windows ce
in military applications, God help final users!).

I would like to see mcp251x driver in mainstream because it can
trigger many interesting situations that perhaps should be discussed
by people that knows much more than me about Linux. For example the PM
code is inelegant (the work queue must look after freezing condition
itself) but I really don't know how to improve it. With threaded
interrupts coming and tasklets being phased out for worqueues and
kernel threads kernel programming could be easier but we risk to get
all the locking burden on the driver writer. So having code reviewed
by good kernel hackers will be even more important!
