Try to take a vanilla mainline 2.6.26 or 2.6.27 and make an industry
project out of it. You'll find out what I mean.

&gt;<i> &gt; For production projects, you need the *whole* stack, including
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; bittime setting, being able to work on random non-release kernels
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; etc and all this is extraordinarily complicated until now and was
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the reason for Marc to move to git.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You are heavily mixing up things: Stack != userspace utils != git
</I>
With &quot;stack&quot; I mean everything you need to do real applications.

- Network Core
- Bit Timing API
- Driver Layer
- Drivers
- Bug fixing for things that make it impossible to run industry
  protocols ontop of the vanilla stack.
- User space tools

&gt;<i> The thing that has to be done is finalizing the TODO list for the CAN
</I>&gt;<i> driver lib from Wolfgang and to bring the drivers into mainline. There
</I>&gt;<i> is nothing &quot;extraordinarily complicated&quot; ... you always try to make
</I>&gt;<i> things complicated but this is no sales conversation here so you can
</I>&gt;<i> also skip that.
</I>
For 2.6.26, it was a matter of Marc working on it for about 3 days
before we had a clean and separated patch series against mainline that
finally worked.

&gt;<i> - trash your crappy 'candump', 'canecho' and 'cansend' apps
</I>
You are free to do whatever you want, and so are we.

&gt;<i> SocketCAN related topics are discussed here. And whenever there are
</I>&gt;<i> questions from people using the ptx-dist OSEALS-BSP tools the
</I>&gt;<i> confusion starts. This is not really nice for OSEALS-BSP users. As
</I>&gt;<i> you are always claim to speak for your $CUSTOMERS you should ask
</I>&gt;<i> them, if they feel comfortable with that situation. I do not (as one
</I>&gt;<i> of your BSP $CUSTOMERS) ...
</I>
Well, in that case you know what you have to do in order to improve the
situation. Tell us what you want to have in your BSP and you'll get it.
I don't see the problem with that.

We have a need for cross compilable userspace tools for SocketCAN since
2005, there had been none at that time out there who have been
maintained on a regular base, with well defined releases against
in-kernel patch stacks etc. So we made a package of our own, in order to
solve real problems. They have been maintained since 2005 and released
on a regular base, they work with all releases we have out there (up to
2.6.26 so far) and they do what they are supposed to in their respective
usecases. We have several tests in our automatic test suites based upon
them, so they solve *our* problems. Nobody said that it works for
everyone else out there. This is Open Source, anyone can do what solves
his problems.

We agree on the fact that things should be unified and this discussion
is completely silly. You told me &quot;why don't you do it&quot; and I told you
that we will do when we either have project time or too much spare time.

It's really that simple.
