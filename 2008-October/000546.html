You can receive CAN messages from a socket as usual with recv() and
alike functions. By default the function will block but the MSG_DONTWAIT
is support as well. Read &quot;man recv&quot; for further information. It seems
that MSG_PEEK is not supported but it would be a nice to have. Oliver,
what do you think.
Also select/poll is supported to get informed about messages arrived.
Maybe the latter is what you are looking for.

Wolfgang.
