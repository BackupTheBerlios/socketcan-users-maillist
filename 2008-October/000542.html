Yes you are. But it's my intention to keep things easy for newbies - and 
for me as a user. I don't want to push you to use the BerliOS tools - 
but you should know them at least. This might have prevented this 
discussion at all. I assume you did not find any time to check them out, 
as you obviously needed the time to write mails :-]

&gt;&gt;<i> SocketCAN related topics are discussed here. And whenever there are
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> questions from people using the ptx-dist OSEALS-BSP tools the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> confusion starts. This is not really nice for OSEALS-BSP users. As

I am able to compile the can-utils myself. It's just the question what 
is provided as a BSP default and if that makes the user happy on the 
second sight.

&gt;<i> We have several tests in our automatic test suites based upon
</I>&gt;<i> them, so they solve *our* problems. Nobody said that it works for

</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>
Yes, of course.

&gt;<i> We agree on the fact that things should be unified and this discussion
</I>&gt;<i> is completely silly. You told me &quot;why don't you do it&quot; and I told you
</I>&gt;<i> that we will do when we either have project time or too much spare time.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It's really that simple.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>
Having tools like 'canconfig' in one place with the majority of 
can-utils makes sense to me as it is viewable for all users and you get 
feedback on it (which is also Open Source idea). This is much better to 
develop and maintain source code than providing a tar.gz linked 
somewhere in the net. And it doesn't cost extra time. If you like to 
contribute it, feel free to do so - if not it's fine either. I think, 
Marc has still SVN access.
