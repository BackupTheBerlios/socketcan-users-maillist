Sorry this is really nonsense. The networklayer defines the socket API 
which is *the* relevant API for all CAN applications in userspace. This 
is indeed the *only* really relevant API - the rest is peanuts and can 
be handled by thousands of OSS contractors/distributors.

You are heavily mixing up things:
Stack != userspace utils != git

The thing that has to be done is finalizing the TODO list for the CAN 
driver lib from Wolfgang and to bring the drivers into mainline. There 
is nothing &quot;extraordinarily complicated&quot; ... you always try to make 
things complicated but this is no sales conversation here so you can 
also skip that.

H&#228;h?

I assume at least 90% of the SocketCAN users using the (as you like: 
hardened, stable and heavily in production use) tools from BerliOS SVN 
that cover almost everything you need.

In the directory

<A HREF="http://www.pengutronix.de/software/socket-can/download/canutils/v3.0/">http://www.pengutronix.de/software/socket-can/download/canutils/v3.0/</A>

are five tools with a very limited functionality and a crappy commandline interface from early days and then *you* ask to send patches for *that*?

Please wake up, browse, compile and use the stuff under socketcan/trunk/can-utils *before* making these kind of suggestions.


If you really read the last paragraph of this thread
<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/pipermail/socketcan-users/2008-October/000523.html">https://lists.berlios.de/pipermail/socketcan-users/2008-October/000523.html</A>

you might have seen my proposal which says in easy (and therefore not so 
kind) words:

- trash your crappy 'candump', 'canecho' and 'cansend' apps
- maintain 'cansequence' and 'canconfig' together in the BerliOS SVN
- send ideas and patches against BerliOS SVN if you feel something is 
missing

Hey what is so complicated in that suggestion? Am i writing in japanese?

SocketCAN related topics are discussed here. And whenever there are 
questions from people using the ptx-dist OSEALS-BSP tools the confusion 
starts. This is not really nice for OSEALS-BSP users. As you are always 
claim to speak for your $CUSTOMERS you should ask them, if they feel 
comfortable with that situation. I do not (as one of your BSP 
$CUSTOMERS) ...
