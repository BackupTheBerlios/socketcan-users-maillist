Hi Steve,

it needed some time, but here is an idea:

We had a similar problem with the PEAK USB Adaptors, we wanted to be
configured with the correct bitrate at plug-in time.

On idea was to use some kind of configuration data that's stored in the flash
of the PEAK-USB-CAN adaptors and patch the PEAK driver to extract this
information and configure the bitrate settings.

But that was a very specific approach.

Now we've done it like this:

Every PEAK-USB-CAN adaptor has a 8-bit serial number that can be flashed with
a Windows tool and can be read out via /proc/pcan

e.g.

<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/socketcan-users">hartko at vwagwolkf320</A>:~$ cat /proc/pcan

*------------ PEAK-Systems CAN interfaces (www.peak-system.com) -------------
*--------------------------  Release_20090215_n  ----------------------------
*---------------- [mod] [isa] [pci] [dng] [usb] [pcc] [net] -----------------
*--------------------- 1 interfaces @ major 251 found -----------------------
*n -type- ndev --base-- irq --btr- --read-- --write- --irqs-- -errors- status
32    usb can2 ffffffff 016 0x001c 00000006 00000001 0000049c 00000000 0x0000

This is our adapter #16 (see 'irq' column as USB adapters have no real irq).
The default is #255 (not set).

What we've done is creating a udev-script that has a configuration file
containing:

&lt;device number&gt; &lt;wanted netdev name&gt; &lt;bitrate&gt;

and whenever a PEAK_USB_CAN adapter is plugged in, the script checks whether
the device number is != 255 and then tries to rename the (automatic created)
netdevice name to the name given in the configuration file.

The renaming is done by the ip(8) tool (when the interface is down).

e.g. ip link set slc0 name myspecialcan

An approach for your setup would be:

Let slcan_attach create a slcX device and rename this to a can0, can1,
sensorcan, actorcan or whatever you like using an udev-script and ip(8).

If you have a &quot;udev rules in place to guide our userspace applications onto
the correct CAN busses&quot; you can surely extend this script to rename the slcX
names to something reasonable for your applications, right?

Regards,
Oliver
