</I>&gt;<i>

&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I have now tried the version from branches/netlink,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; but unfortunately I am still able to provoke kernel
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; panics.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; As I have been trying to provoke the panics, it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; now seems to me the problem is related to freeing
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of the skb, as the only situation where I feel
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the driver is truly stable, is when I have modified
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the code so that the outgoing packet is neither freed
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; nor fed into netif_rx. Even reducing skb handling to the
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This can easily be achieved by writing 0 to can_echo (to disabled the
</I>&gt;<i> IFF_ECHO flag).
</I>
I see. I did remove the setting of the IFF_ECHO flag in one
of my attempts to track this down, but that did not help.
Maybe because the echo procedure just moved to af_can.c?

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; procedure of just saving the skb when sending (in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; sja1000_start_xmit) and then freeing it at transmission
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; complete interrupt is enough to provoke a panic:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>[zap!]
&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I have compiled the CAN-stuff into the kernel. And there
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; is some problem with the presentation of symbols; matching
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hm, why? Do you have CONFIG_KALLSYMS=y in your .config?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Ok, that may be the problem...

[zap!]
&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Admittedly, it is not easy to provoke the panics, but I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; often succeed with the following procedure:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 0. Start a script that repeatedly opens a can socket, sends
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; some traffic, and then closes it. Also, start a script that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; repeatedly tries to reset CAN via sysfs.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> By calling &quot;echo 1 &gt; /sys/.../can_restart&quot;?
</I>
Yes.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 1. Detach and attach the physical CAN socket a few times.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Leave socket detached.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 2. Bring the ethernet link (attached to the same machine)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; down and up a few times (Physically detach/attach cable).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Is this necessary to trigger the Oops? I can't see any obvious relation
</I>&gt;<i> with CAN.
</I>
I am not sure. It helps in provoking them, anyway. When I
started to try to track this, I switched from pre-emptive
to non pre-emptive kernel (to see if that had anything to
do with the problem), and then started the scripts (restarting,
open; send-traffic; close) and had them running for 20+ hours
without problems. Then I needed to do some unrelated work
concerning ifplugd. Kaboom, almost immediately when starting
fiddling with the Ethernet cable, I got a panic. Thereafter
I include this as a way to provoke the panic within a shorter
time.

So the problem may not be exclusively with the CAN driver,
but in some obscure interaction with Ethernet. No problems
with Ethernet when CAN is not present though. The other way
around (no Ethernet and CAN present) I have not tried (yet)
as such a setup carries a set of practical complications.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 3. Attach the physical CAN socket. Now, kernel panic may
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; occur. If not, repeat from 1.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What do you mean with attach and detach.
</I>
I mean physically connect/disconnect the CAN bus.

Thanks,
Mikael.
