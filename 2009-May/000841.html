<PRE>Oliver,
Our application has 4 separate physical networks, one behind each slc interface.

slc0                      node0
 |                          |
t---------------------------------t

The slc0 is also the NMT.
The nodes are small embedded systems, which run ESA's microCanOpenPlus firmware stack, on top of Keil's RTX RL-ARM kernel, on top of a NXP LCP2364.

The slc0 is initiating an SDO access. (Node Object dictionary read or write)
The node is responding to the SDO access.

-Steve

Which looks interesting. But i'm not a tty specialist and therefore we
should ask people like Alan Cox, who is working on the slip.c driver.
For that, i would be needed to have the slcan driver in mainline or
provide a similar patch for the slip.c driver ...
My assumption is that there are solutions for SLIP that do not need this
1:1 assignment.

But back to your original question:
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> However, when we run a test which moves a lot of data (at a low rate), we find that every mod 64K received packets, the socketcan layer appears to lock up.
</I>
This is presumably not a PF_CAN network layer issue but something in the
network driver (here: slcan.c) or below.

&gt;<i>   The odd thing is, if we inject a packet onto the network from another master, then data starts flowing again.
</I>
Just to get your setup in detail:

  slc0   slc1   slc2   slc3   other_master
   |      |      |      |        |
|<i>------------------------------------------|
</I>
Right?

Who is receiving and who is sending in this setup?

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Has anyone else seen their network stop?
</I>
Only when having bugs in the CAN hardware's interrupt handling.

Regards,
Oliver
