Hi Wolfgang,

this is indeed a wanted feature, as you may have more than one application
working on the same CAN-netdevice. Netdevices only send or receive frames -
they do not implement any loopback funktionality.
But this functionality is important implementing a broadcast bus like the
CAN-bus.

E.g. two application A and B

A is sending CAN-ID 0x123 on can0
B wants to receive everything from can0 (not only what is received be the
netdevice but even what is sent by other applicatons on this local box)

So the really correct behaviour would be to check on every correctly
transmitted CAN-frame inside the CAN-netdevice and AFTER the correct
transmission on the bus to send this explicit CAN-Frame up to the
network-layer (as it has been received).

But this would lead to very complex concepts inside the CAN-netdevice driver
(e.g. especially when the CAN-controller supports buffering or queues) so we
decided to realize the loopback with the can_send() function within
af_can.c.

If there is no one listening for the 'sent' frames they are just discarded
as anything else no one is interested in.
So implementing a correct broadcast concept the loopback functionality for
numerous userland-applications is mandatory.

Why would you like to switch it off?

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The number of queued TX and RX messages seems to be limited. Can these
</I>&gt;<i> limits be adapted somehow?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
Which queues do you mean? The ones from the socket into the userspace or
from the netdevice into the networklayer? Or vice versa?

We are just using the standard queue lengths provided by Linux, but i think
it should be possible to 'tune' these queue lengths - but currently i don't
know how. Maybe Urs can give any hints but he's currently in vacation till
next monday. Or you may look into man pages or in other sources. We never
had any problems with queue lengths. If you are working with cyclic
messages, you should consider to use the content-filtering provided by the
broadcast manager (see doc on www.llcf.de chapter 7). That massively reduces
the traffic kernelspace -&gt; userspace. It's a cool swiss knife for broadcast
handling.

&gt;<i> Thanks for help.

Was a pleasure ;-)

Oliver
