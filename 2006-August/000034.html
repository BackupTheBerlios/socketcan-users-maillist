</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I think that all these misconceptions melt down to the question if you
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> consider our CAN interface to be at data link or at network layer:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> CAN can be put quite well to the network layer. Then local loopback
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> makes sense and provides a nice additional feature compared to existing
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> CAN APIs. E.g., you could then run several CANopen nodes on the same
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> host and they could communicate with each other - likely more of a test
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> scenario than a reasonable production design, but still useful.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If you consider the CAN API more as an interface to the data link layer
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (and this is what I did yesterday implicitly), local loopback is no
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> longer correct. You may argue this is not how users should see CAN, but
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that doesn't solve the problem.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> So, what to do? Having a global switch like a module parameter is not an
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> elegant solution in my eyes. The day will come when you have
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> applications of both types on a complex host, requiring loopback on and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> off at the same time - boom. Actually, this property is more something
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the user should decide about in the transmitting application. How?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Either via the socket type or the protocol. I would say the best way is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> now the latter, e.g. something like this:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     socket(PF_CAN, SOCK_RAW, CAN_PROTO_NET); /* local loopback */
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     socket(PF_CAN, SOCK_RAW, CAN_PROTO_DEVICE); /* no loopback */
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This hands back the control to the individual user, the one who
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (typically) knows best what should happen to a frame in the core. :)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> And what should become protocol 0, i.e. the default one? Well, that's
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> tricky, maybe we should do a poll on this. My believe is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> CAN_PROTO_DEVICE. But given good documentation of the differences (and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the recommendation to RT users to always provide the protocol
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> explicitly), I could personally also live with the other way around.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> What do you all think?

</I>&gt;<i> Hi Jan,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> thanks for these clarifying words! The differentiation is hitting the
</I>&gt;<i> point! I was also active this afternoon and found out, that the guys
</I>&gt;<i> working on AppleTalk (that allows the sending of broadcasts) and the
</I>&gt;<i> PACKET-socket have the same problems of how to loop back their own sent
</I>&gt;<i> stuff.
</I>
I may miss some path, but packet sockets really don't appear to me like
they are looping anything back (only to taps - like any networking
device). And what AppleTalk protocol precisely is looped back? I bet
DDD, as it's comparable to IP. In contrast, IPX doesn't loop back (IIRC
my &gt; 10 years old experiences) while it's also layer 3. No perfect world.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The common behaviour i have recognized is: Loop back to everyone, except
</I>&gt;<i> the originating socket. Aha! This sounds definitely like what we were
</I>&gt;<i> searching here and what the users would probably expect most.
</I>
At least for IP multicast, there is no such filtering, only the socket
option IP_MULTICAST_LOOP which works per host. I would therefore avoid
such complications.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I have been checking the skbuff-structure for appropriate space to save
</I>&gt;<i> the pointer to the sock-structure as reference so that the receiving
</I>&gt;<i> socket can identify his self created stuff. So you can discard the
</I>&gt;<i> CAN-frames you have been sending before (as default).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> And if there is any really need(?) to receive what you've been sending
</I>&gt;<i> before, there could be some socket-option to disable the discarding. But
</I>&gt;<i> this should be considered to be implemented only on request ...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That looks as a quite good idea to me (and i'm already thinking on a
</I>&gt;<i> tiny patch).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What you you all think on this solution?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Additionally this idea can offer the possibility to decide for each
</I>&gt;<i> socket, if the sent data should be looped back to other local users (by
</I>&gt;<i> default) or not (by sockopt or protocol as you suggested above). E.g. if
</I>&gt;<i> the pointer in the sent skbuff holding the sk is set to NULL the
</I>&gt;<i> loopback for this CAN-frame is disabled. So you also have an
</I>&gt;<i> runtime-configurable performance tuning - this meets your desires,
</I>
Don't forget: for hard RT, s/performance/WCET/. But low-end users
without hard constraints will certainly also worry about the former.

&gt;<i> right? ;-)
</I>
Protocols look more handy too me (from a user POV) and are easier
acceptable if we really go for default on. Socket options are not that
well visible, and we should better reduce the level of surprise.

But let's ask for other opinions:

POLL 1: How to control TX loopback behaviour?
	[ ] socket option
	[ ] two protocols
	[ ] .................
	    (please describe)

POLL 2: What should be the default behaviour?
	[ ] loopback
	[ ] no loopback
