Hey Jan,

want kind of discussion would you like to start here? Maybe you should look
on what has been done in the source, before shooting around.
Yes, we're using standard network devices and this works fine with libpcap.

But you're always mixing addressing concepts &amp; tools you know from TCP/IP
networking with the completely different addressing concept used by CAN.

E.g. there would never been something like a Ethernet promiscuous mode on
CAN-network interfaces, as there are no ethernet-addresses. And there will
never be something that compares to the routing of IP-packets, as there are
no ARP, Ethernet, IP nor TCP-headers in CAN.

So what has to be accomplished here is to *transfer* the broken (from normal
IT view) addressing concept of the CAN-bus *into* what the normal IT
expects, when they want to use the CAN with established and well know
interfaces like the BSD-socket interface.

If you face the network-layer (that makes the routing and the protocols) the
current implementation does exactly this routing and the protocols.

You may rename the 'loopback' functionality and the receive-lists as the
analogy of what you know from routing of other networking implementations.
And it IS standard that several applications can communicate on the same
machine via TCP/IP - so it has nothing to do with 'inventing some kind of
new IPC'. And even if the *majority* of IP-applications are mostly
communicating with other computers, the PF_INET networkstack is implemented
to support this local communication also.

Sorry, but you are wrong here. Your suggestions do not lead to a 'standard
behaviour'.

If you do not need 'local CAN-routing' - fine. But this depends on YOUR
application and YOUR testbed.

As long as even experienced peoples like Wolfgang do not use the fancy
filter possibilities in kernel space, that really reduces system load, a
discussion about the overhead created by skb_clone() and netif_rx() becomes
absurd. And these two functions are Linux core business and therefore highly
efficient.

In my opinion disabling the 'local CAN-routing' that cares for the common
known network behaviour is depending on applications &amp; testbeds. So if you
do not need 'local CAN-routing' in your environment and this really boosts
your performance(?), this is an option for experts to disable the 'local
CAN-routing' - nothing more. And if you disable the 'local CAN routing' you
have to know what you're doing even when you leave the path of common
expectations of other users.

Thinking about disabling this feature i would suggest a commandline
parameter for can.ko (e.g. disable_loopback = 1) and we can add it to
/proc/net/can/disable_loopback ...

Oliver

p.s. Sorry my broken Mailer crashed the threading on the mailing list, but i
wanted to react before 19:00 :-/
