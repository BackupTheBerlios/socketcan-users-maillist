<PRE>Hi Oliver,

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I thought you are using standard network devices. Isn't libpcap working
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; for CAN yet? *That's* the way for sniffing frames. I think Pengutronix
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; had once something running.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Hey Jan,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> want kind of discussion would you like to start here? Maybe you should
</I>look
&gt;<i> on what has been done in the source, before shooting around.
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, we're using standard network devices and this works fine with
</I>libpcap.
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> But you're always mixing addressing concepts &amp; tools you know from TCP/IP
</I>&gt;<i> networking with the completely different addressing concept used by CAN.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> E.g. there would never been something like a Ethernet promiscuous mode on
</I>&gt;<i> CAN-network interfaces, as there are no ethernet-addresses. And there will
</I>&gt;<i> never be something that compares to the routing of IP-packets, as
</I>there are
&gt;<i> no ARP, Ethernet, IP nor TCP-headers in CAN.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So what has to be accomplished here is to *transfer* the broken (from
</I>normal
&gt;<i> IT view) addressing concept of the CAN-bus *into* what the normal IT
</I>&gt;<i> expects, when they want to use the CAN with established and well know
</I>&gt;<i> interfaces like the BSD-socket interface.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If you face the network-layer (that makes the routing and the
</I>protocols) the
&gt;<i> current implementation does exactly this routing and the protocols.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> You may rename the 'loopback' functionality and the receive-lists as the
</I>&gt;<i> analogy of what you know from routing of other networking implementations.
</I>&gt;<i> And it IS standard that several applications can communicate on the same
</I>&gt;<i> machine via TCP/IP - so it has nothing to do with 'inventing some kind of
</I>&gt;<i> new IPC'. And even if the *majority* of IP-applications are mostly
</I>&gt;<i> communicating with other computers, the PF_INET networkstack is
</I>implemented
&gt;<i> to support this local communication also.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Sorry, but you are wrong here. Your suggestions do not lead to a 'standard
</I>&gt;<i> behaviour'.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If you do not need 'local CAN-routing' - fine. But this depends on YOUR
</I>&gt;<i> application and YOUR testbed.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As long as even experienced peoples like Wolfgang do not use the fancy
</I>&gt;<i> filter possibilities in kernel space, that really reduces system load, a
</I>&gt;<i> discussion about the overhead created by skb_clone() and netif_rx()
</I>becomes
&gt;<i> absurd. And these two functions are Linux core business and therefore
</I>highly
&gt;<i> efficient.
</I>
Be aware that I'm not an end user of CAN software. One of my jobs is 
to provide core software _to_ CAN users. The socketcan driver is quite
new and we have little experience. So far we used to well know 
drivers like PCAN, OCAN, lincan, etc. with its limitations. In the
CAN field there are plenty of use cases and I can imagine, that
the loopback feature is not wanted in every application, especially
if they use the socketcan driver as before (one application,
no filters, etc.). On the other hand, I already know some people
liking the feature.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In my opinion disabling the 'local CAN-routing' that cares for the common
</I>&gt;<i> known network behaviour is depending on applications &amp; testbeds. So if you
</I>&gt;<i> do not need 'local CAN-routing' in your environment and this really boosts
</I>&gt;<i> your performance(?), this is an option for experts to disable the 'local
</I>&gt;<i> CAN-routing' - nothing more. And if you disable the 'local CAN
</I>routing' you
&gt;<i> have to know what you're doing even when you leave the path of common
</I>&gt;<i> expectations of other users.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Thinking about disabling this feature i would suggest a commandline
</I>&gt;<i> parameter for can.ko (e.g. disable_loopback = 1) and we can add it to
</I>&gt;<i> /proc/net/can/disable_loopback ...
</I>
Fine for me. I would just switch it off by default because it then
behaves as expected (from the normal CAN driver stand-point).

Wolfgang.
