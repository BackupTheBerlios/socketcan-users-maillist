<PRE>Hi Oliver,

thinking about the whole issue also from your POV again, I realised that
my position was too strict. When considering CAN frames as multicast,
what certainly matches best, local delivery is reasonable. But, as this
thread may have indicated, it's at the same time also a surprising
feature for (I'm still convinced) a huge group of users.

I think that all these misconceptions melt down to the question if you
consider our CAN interface to be at data link or at network layer:

CAN can be put quite well to the network layer. Then local loopback
makes sense and provides a nice additional feature compared to existing
CAN APIs. E.g., you could then run several CANopen nodes on the same
host and they could communicate with each other - likely more of a test
scenario than a reasonable production design, but still useful.

If you consider the CAN API more as an interface to the data link layer
(and this is what I did yesterday implicitly), local loopback is no
longer correct. You may argue this is not how users should see CAN, but
that doesn't solve the problem.

So, what to do? Having a global switch like a module parameter is not an
elegant solution in my eyes. The day will come when you have
applications of both types on a complex host, requiring loopback on and
off at the same time - boom. Actually, this property is more something
the user should decide about in the transmitting application. How?
Either via the socket type or the protocol. I would say the best way is
now the latter, e.g. something like this:

	socket(PF_CAN, SOCK_RAW, CAN_PROTO_NET); /* local loopback */
	socket(PF_CAN, SOCK_RAW, CAN_PROTO_DEVICE); /* no loopback */

This hands back the control to the individual user, the one who
(typically) knows best what should happen to a frame in the core. :)

And what should become protocol 0, i.e. the default one? Well, that's
tricky, maybe we should do a poll on this. My believe is
CAN_PROTO_DEVICE. But given good documentation of the differences (and
the recommendation to RT users to always provide the protocol
explicitly), I could personally also live with the other way around.

What do you all think?

Jan
