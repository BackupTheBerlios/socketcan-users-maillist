</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> this is indeed a wanted feature, as you may have more than one

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> working on the same CAN-netdevice. Netdevices only send or receive

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> But this functionality is important implementing a broadcast bus like
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> CAN-bus.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>         
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Mmh, that's not that obvious to me (did I miss the related discussion on
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> this?). 
</I>Hm - there was never a discussion on this, as we did not discuss these 
things in this details since end of last year ...
&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> We are not designing a new IPC mechanism here, but a networking
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> API.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>       
</I>Yep. But the question is, how users that are coming from the 
standard-IT-business (or fresh from university making a diploma in 
computer science) would expect the system to work, when they are running 
several processes accessing one CAN-bus via RAW-Sockets. We had exactly 
that problem, that e.g. the debugging of CAN-applications (using the 
on-board RAW-socket reader tools like 'candump') was impossible as you 
were not able to see the frames that the other application / 
protocol-instance was sending on the bus. This was unusable. And 
therefore we checked the solutions

- implement it into the netdevice driver (very complex)
- implement it into af_can.c (very easy)

The implementation into af_can.c caused the vcan-driver to become 
something like a nul device.

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I'm not disputing that this can be a useful feature for certain
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> applications, but I'm convinced it should be only optional and off by
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> default. 
</I>I have many other use-cases (where debugging and logging are the most 
important ones) that require the loopback functionality. It's the only 
way to make an application movable so that it is regardless on which 
linux-box it is running. If you have three applications runnig 
independently on three linux-boxes and talking to each other (and to 
other CAN-ECUs), i would expect, that i can also put these three 
applications onto one linux box talking to each other and to other ECUs. 
And all this without recompiling - that's standard behaviour in other 
network protocols! And that is implemented! If there is a really need to 
disable the loopback, i am not against some CONFIG-switch. But it has to 
be ON by default, as this is the behaviour most IT application 
programmers would expect. Not seeing completely whats going on on the 
bus is dissatisfying. If you make an TCP-dump you also get incoming and 
outgoing traffic.
&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> That would follow the rule of least surprise when comparing CAN
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> with other networking devices.
</I>The CAN has multiple differences to what we know from other networking 
stuff (e.g. due to it's different addressing concept). This makes it 
that complicated to create a socket interface with a IT flavour, that's 
derived from TCP/IP. The IP has ethernet-addresses, IP -address, ports 
and routing. The CAN-sockets have the RX-dispatcher to distribute 
registered CAN-Frames - a comletely different approach to the Internet 
Protocol but necessary to handle CAN-addressing needs.
&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>  The overhead when it's unused is another
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> counterargument.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>       
</I>Doing it like it's implemented guarantees the minimum overhead 
(presuming that loopback is needed).
And loopback IS needed (see above).
&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> This feature is not included in the RT-variant so far, and I can only
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> imagine that it would make sense to add it if
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>  A) people ask for it and
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>  B) it's user-controllable.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>       
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Yes, I already put it on my TODO list. I would made it an option
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> configurable via kernel configuration parameter. I also don't like to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> have it build in by default.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>I ask for it :-)

I don't know, how you have been working so far. Did you never use some 
tracing tools on your local machine?
If not - why not? I think any other developer uses tcpdump and etherreal 
on his local machine, when he programms / debugs his modified 
application or networking code!?!!

So it should be really ON by default.
&gt;<i> My feeling is that the involved code size increment can be fairly small,
</I>&gt;<i> rather the lengthened code path on transmission (+it's locking
</I>&gt;<i> dependencies) worries me when it's not at least runtime-configurable.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>Yes - it is indeed small and has zero copying ... see af_can.c:

/**************************************************/
/* af_can tx path                                 */
/**************************************************/

int can_send(struct sk_buff *skb)
{
	struct sk_buff *newskb = skb_clone(skb, GFP_ATOMIC);
	int err;

	if (!(skb-&gt;dev-&gt;flags &amp; IFF_UP))
		err = -ENETDOWN;
	else if ((err = dev_queue_xmit(skb)) &gt; 0)  /* send to netdevice */
		err = net_xmit_errno(err);

	/* update statistics */
	stats.tx_frames++;
	stats.tx_frames_delta++;

	newskb-&gt;protocol  = htons(ETH_P_CAN);
	newskb-&gt;ip_summed = CHECKSUM_UNNECESSARY;
	netif_rx(newskb);                          /* local loopback */

	return err;
}

&gt;<i> However, point A) still stands. Or could someone explain the broad
</I>&gt;<i> usefulness to me? 
</I>Done! Can you follow my arguments knowing these requirements now?

Regards,

Oliver
