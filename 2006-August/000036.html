</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Hm - i just asked google for packet / socket / loopback ...

<A HREF="http://www.google.de/search?q=packet+socket+loopback&amp;hl=de&amp;lr=&amp;start=10&amp;sa=N">http://www.google.de/search?q=packet+socket+loopback&amp;hl=de&amp;lr=&amp;start=10&amp;sa=N</A>

At this link you may get an insight in the AppleTalk problem that was 
figured out on sending AppleTalk-broadcasts:
<A HREF="http://lists.suse.com/archive/suse-amd64/2005-Sep/0100.html">http://lists.suse.com/archive/suse-amd64/2005-Sep/0100.html</A>

And at this link there was a discussion from 2000 about the 
loopback-device in promiscuous mode:
<A HREF="http://www.ethereal.com/lists/ethereal-dev/200009/msg00095.html">http://www.ethereal.com/lists/ethereal-dev/200009/msg00095.html</A>

There's a comment in the top-of-CVS-tree &quot;pcap-linux.c&quot; at tcpdump.org
that says

 * Known bugs:
 *   - setting promiscuous on loopback gives every packet twice


So all this went into linux/net/core/dev.c in dev_queue_xmin_nit()

Btw. as you stated above we consider the CAN to be something like 
multicast (better broadcast!), local delivery is reasonable we just have 
to check for other implementations and how this can be transfered to 
what we need regarding a proper CAN integration ...

&gt;<i> &gt; The common behaviour i have recognized is: Loop back to everyone,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; except the originating socket. Aha! This sounds definitely like
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; what we were searching here and what the users would probably
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; expect most.
</I>
Yep!

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  At least for IP multicast, there is no such filtering, only the
</I>&gt;<i>  socket option IP_MULTICAST_LOOP which works per host. I would
</I>&gt;<i>  therefore avoid such complications.
</I>
See references above. IMO you can not map straight to IP in this case.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I have been checking the skbuff-structure for appropriate space to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; save the pointer to the sock-structure as reference so that the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; receiving socket can identify his self created stuff. So you can
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; discard the CAN-frames you have been sending before (as default).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; And if there is any really need(?) to receive what you've been
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; sending before, there could be some socket-option to disable the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; discarding. But this should be considered to be implemented only on
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; request ...
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; That looks as a quite good idea to me (and i'm already thinking on
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; a tiny patch).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; What you you all think on this solution?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Additionally this idea can offer the possibility to decide for each
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  socket, if the sent data should be looped back to other local
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; users (by default) or not (by sockopt or protocol as you suggested
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; above). E.g. if the pointer in the sent skbuff holding the sk is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; set to NULL the loopback for this CAN-frame is disabled. So you
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; also have an runtime-configurable performance tuning - this meets
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; your desires,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  Don't forget: for hard RT, s/performance/WCET/. But low-end users
</I>&gt;<i>  without hard constraints will certainly also worry about the former.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; right? ;-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  Protocols look more handy too me (from a user POV) and are easier
</I>&gt;<i>  acceptable if we really go for default on. Socket options are not
</I>&gt;<i>  that well visible, and we should better reduce the level of surprise.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
No principal concerns from my side for an additional protocol for RAW 
PF_CAN sockets with a default for 'local CAN broadcast routing' which 
meets the real CAN behaviour. But it looks like an expert-tuning-option 
to me, as it doesn't change a remarkable behaviour from the users POV 
using *his* socket. It has only an impact on other CAN-users on the same 
machine that are probably not there in your testbed.

General: IMO the 'loopback' expression stands for an other technical 
idea and we should not mix it with the 'broadcast' concept, we need to 
have for a CAN integration.

Summarizing the facts:

1. 'local CAN broadcast routing' is in principle a correct and wanted 
behaviour for a CAN integration in socket-can. Therefore this behaviour 
defines the default.

2. getting sent CAN-frames back to the originating socket is typically 
an unwanted and unexpected behaviour

3. due to performance or application needs it must be possible to send 
CAN-frames via RAW-sockets to netdevices that not locally re-routed 
(like item 1)

Getting Wolfgangs poll (modified):

  POLL 1: How to control TX re-route behaviour for CAN_RAW-sockets?
  	[X] socket option
  	[ ] two protocols
  	[ ] .................
  	    (please describe)

        Note: Controlling with socket options allows to change
        the behaviour during run-time.

        (Remark from Oliver: IMO a real expert-option - see fact 3)
  
  POLL 2: What should be the default behaviour on TX?
  	[X] re-route sent frames to other applications on the local machine
  	[ ] only write to CAN-bus

        (Remark from Oliver: It's CAN *broadcasting* - see fact 1)

  POLL 3: Should the message be looped back to the
          sending socket as well? 

  	[X] no 
  	[ ] yes 
  	[X] the option should be configurable (via setsockopt) 

        (Remark from Oliver: see fact 2)

//        Note: looping back to all sockets can be easily implemented
//              while the other choices are more complex/tricky.

No! I found a quite easy sollution to implement this (about 6 LOC).


So for me it looks like two action items right now:

1. Ensure that sent CAN-frames are not received by the originating 
RAW-socket
2. create two new sockopts for CAN_RAW sockets, something like ...
   a) DISABLE_TX_RE_ROUTING
   b) RECEIVE_SENT_FRAMES

OK for you all?

Regards,
Oliver
