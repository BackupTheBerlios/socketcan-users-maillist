It's mainly for systems based on micro-controllers or even less
intelligent logic.

&gt;<i> Can your CAN chip receive RTR frames and put them to software without the
</I>&gt;<i> hardware transmitting something?
</I>
I remember heavy head and stomach ache while fighting with the i82527
long time ago.

...
&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Having a generic CAN driver interface is one of the major motivations for
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> SocketCAN. You really don't want to have hardware-specific (&quot;N mailboxes&quot;)
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> configuration interfaces which leads into a maintenance hell.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Yes, I also do not see a generic way yet to support per mailbox (or
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> message object) filtering.
</I>&gt;<i> Ack.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I've had some experience with the CAN chip within the c167 infineon cpu, which I
</I>&gt;<i> believe is similar to the bosch cc770 can chip.
</I>&gt;<i> Such setup with different 'mailboxes' only worked when there is a system-wide
</I>&gt;<i> policy defined which CAN id go via which mailbox.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> a small piece of history:
</I>&gt;<i> Before I found that such policy is _really_ required (although I found this nowhere
</I>&gt;<i> in the datasheets), I ran into a race condition of the hardware (!).
</I>&gt;<i> If you put (in that specific CAN chip) 2 different CANids in TX mailboxes, but whose
</I>&gt;<i> CANids do match within the global receive mask, and the lowest CAN id is put in a 
</I>&gt;<i> mailbox after the higher(=lower priority on CAN) CANid, then the CAN chip would send
</I>&gt;<i> the higher priority CAN id first (=good), but fails to find the correct TX mailbox
</I>&gt;<i> in the CAN chip. Instead, it marks the first matched mailbox(= higher CAN id, which
</I>&gt;<i> was not sent!) as transmitted. Subsequently, it finds the second mailbox (with the 
</I>&gt;<i> CANid that was just sent) as wanting transmission ......
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not sure on the precise relationship between CAN id's, or how to configure
</I>&gt;<i> the mailboxes (its about 8years ago).
</I>&gt;<i> Anyway, I ended up in a CAN frame sent back to back because I used &gt;1 TX mailbox.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> =&gt; rule 1: only use 1 tx mailbox.
</I>
Yes, and furthermore, full featured support for the i82527 is not really
 possible.

...
&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> But please check if it's really needed and if you probably have a different
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> view on the general approach of SocketCAN now.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Some kind of generic hardware filter support might be useful for some
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> corner cases, I think. Does anyone else find it useful?
</I>&gt;<i> I have long stopped using hardware filters.
</I>&gt;<i> Please note this is only my experience.
</I>&gt;<i> If a decent netlink based mechanism would emerge, not affecting
</I>&gt;<i> the software filters, and not trying to be intelligent, but just relaying
</I>&gt;<i> a system wide policy into a CAN chip, then it would not hurt?
</I>&gt;<i> And chips implementing it, could then at least measure their performance gain (and
</I>&gt;<i> see if it was worth the effort). (This last issue could be measured with some
</I>&gt;<i> quick sysfs properties too)
</I>
I agree, only some simple and general filtering does have a chance to
get accepted. Something which could be supported by most CAN controllers
is global filtering via global mask and id.

Wolfgang.
