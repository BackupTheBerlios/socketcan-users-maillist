<PRE>I have now ported the c_can driver to the socketcan trunk. So far it 
compiles and sort of works. I got a few questions though:

* The hynix h7202 hardware design really is braindamaged. Robert, did 
the driver really work back when it was written? I have observed that 
doing the double reads and the waits when writing certainly is 
necessary, but as there are some other peripherals on the AMBA bus it's 
also necessary to lock against these accesses. I currently use 2 UARTS 
for development (1 for logging console, the other with SLIP). At least 
one of ten reads (or writes for that matter) failed because I think 
kernel preemption kicked in and let the UART driver do some work. So 
what I did as a temporary hack is putting the CAN register read/write 
methods into the big kernel lock so no other peripheral can read/write 
to the AMBA bus. This seems to work, but of course is a very very poor 
solution. Btw. is it allowed to take the kernel lock inside an ISR? Any 
ideas how to implement a finer grained locking mechanisms for all AMBA 
peripherals without completely hacking up the kernel?

* It still seems that some strange things are happening on the CAN IP. 
For example, when I read the interrupt register during the ISR I 
sometimes get an invalid value (0x0063). Valid values may be 0x8000 
(status) or 0x0001-0x0020 for a pending message object. I wonder if 
there still is some misbehaviour in when reading/writing registers or 
the interrupt handling breaks something. Any ideas on that?

* There is a candev module in the socketcan trunk. I adapted the driver 
to use the candev module. Is this the right thing to do? Also I've seen 
that the candev driver is not tagged with a mod license, so it 'taints' 
the kernel when loading.

* I have changed the driver (h7202 part) to be a platform_driver as the 
CAN is directly on the hynix chip. I hope this is the correct way to do it?

* Currently to load the h7202can driver as a module I have to load 
candev, c_can and h7202can modules. I just wondered if this isn't a bit 
too modular. What you think?

Best regards,
Simon
