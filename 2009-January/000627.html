Hello Robert,

the SocketCAN sockets with all it's filters and CAN network devices are 
a relatively closed eco-system in the Linux Kernel. The CAN core can 
only use netdevices with ARPHDR_CAN and no ARPHRD_ETHER as ethernet 
cards have. This is caused by a completely different addressing schema 
between 'broadcasting some kind of sender addresses' and ethernet 
addressing (see linux/Documentation/networking/can.txt).

As you would like to push the CAN frames over IP (preferable UDP) only 
exchanging the CAN netdev driver with an ethernet card would be not 
enough, as the ethernet card itself cannot speak IP ...

 From what i've understood from your requirements, i would suggest to 
write some application in userspace, that

- get's CAN frames via virtual CAN interfaces (vcan) and put's them into 
a UDP/IP socket - or alternatively you can write bare ethernet frames 
using packet sockets (AF_PACKET) - or whatever needed

- gets UDP (or whatever) packets and push them into the approriate vcan 
interface

This is a very easy thing to do. Are you familiar with virtual CAN 
netdevices?

Your existing application run's on virtual CAN interfaces and everything 
it writes to the vcan0 will show up in your CAN2UDP bridge program due 
to the internal loopback mechanism of the SocketCAN core - and vice versa.

If you need to preserve your application as-is (e.g. you can't tell it 
to use different CAN netdevices like vcan0 and vcan1 instead of can0 and 
can1) you can create virtual CAN netdevices with 'real' CAN interface 
names, like:

ip link add dev can0 type vcan

This looks a bit hackish but probably fit's into your needs ;-)
How to create vcan's is also available in can.txt.

I hope these ideas helped you so far. Or did i miss anything of your 
requirements?

Regards,
Oliver
