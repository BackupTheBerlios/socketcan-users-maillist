</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If so, i would add them to an other new big array containing the the (64 bit)

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> What do you think about this idea?
</I>&gt;<i> Hi Oliver,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I like this idea. I liked it so much, that I just tried it :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But the results are not exactly what I want. I used candump as base and created a simple array, as you suggested (only for the frames, none for the timestamps. I need them, but for testing purposes I can life without them). Now the problem is the cpu load, again. I have ~18-20% idle time and ~60% for candump. Basically I can dump the frames this way, but in my application dumping the frames is not the only task. I need a bit more cpu time than the remaining 20%.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> When I used the increased socket buffer size I had plenty cpu time available (&gt;70%), but no memory for my application left. With an simple buffer I have plenty of memory available (&gt;90MB), but not enough cpu time left. :(
</I>
Ok, i must admit this is a bit like fishing in murky waters but i do not 
know which impact the recvmsg() syscall hass in this game.

When integrating the support for dropcounts i moved the receiption of 
CAN frames from recvfrom() to recvmsg() to get all the information 
including timestamps and dropcounts with one syscall:

<A HREF="http://svn.berlios.de/wsvn/socketcan?op=comp&amp;compare[">http://svn.berlios.de/wsvn/socketcan?op=comp&amp;compare[</A>]=/trunk/can-utils/<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/socketcan-users">candump.c at 1110</A>&amp;compare[]=/trunk/can-utils/<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/socketcan-users">candump.c at 1111</A>

This has an increased effort in setting and parsing cmsg structures.

Maybe you can try to modify the rev1110 to your needs (with the CAN 
frame array) or use the very simple socketcan/test/tst-raw.c source as a 
basis that only uses read() without any multi-socket- nor select()-support.

This would be interesting to see if we really can save remarkable 
amounts of CPU time without having the full-featured candump mechanisms.

Best regards &amp; thanks for the interesting CPU/MEM tradeoff problem ;-)

Oliver

</I>&gt;<i> It seems, that I have to optimize either the memory consumption of the socket buffer or the cpu load of the frame fetching. Maybe the right tradeoff between user space and socket is the clue.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm familiar with linux, but I'm no kernel hacker. I think, you have way more experience in this area (at least you implemented many stuff in kernel space for socketcan ;) ), so do you think I can get my application running with one of the three options from above? Or I'm missing some &quot;simple&quot; other option? (beside from switching the cpu, of course)
</I>&gt;<i>
