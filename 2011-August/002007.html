Hi all, back again :)

Well, Wolfgang, finally we got a pretty fine working kernel 2.6.39 including
full flexcan support.
Both channels work smoothly. All Ip commands are supported and I think I
have to thank not only our supplier but some folks in this forum too.

But there is one question left that was mentioned in this thread a while
back.

Scenario is that I have two physical CAN channels. To both of them might be
some devices connected or, what is important, may be not connected.
The i.MX25 features two separate masters, each one responsible for only one
bus.
Additional it features one slave that hooks on one of the channels. But this
slave is just a piece of software, not a physical device.

Now what happens is, that the physical channels might be unconnected. On one
of the channels there is the slave hooked. But the interface of both
channels is flooding my syslog with 
&quot;SC2:write error; : No buffer space available&quot;

Is there a chance to get rid of this message?
(Besides the one from throwing this error out of the source code)

Just toi make clear the differences to the scenario we had with the older
kernels:
We do not have any problem with the bus! As soon as I connect any kind of
device to the physical bus, the error message disappears and the bus is up
and running. 

I configured the bus with 

        ifconfig $1 down
        echo &quot;$1: Setting bitrate $BITRATE, restart $RESTART&quot;
        ip link set $1 type can bitrate $BITRATE triple-sampling on
        ip link set $1 type can restart-ms $RESTART
        ifconfig $1 up

where $RESTART is a value of 100 and $1 ist can0 or can1, $BITRATE is 125000

Thanks again
Ulrich
