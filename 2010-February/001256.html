</I>I use CAN for ~11 years (rather much, we do automotive).
I never enabled the bus-error interrupts anywhere embedded.
To research odd behaviour, the error counters were helpfull,
 and oscilloscope devices on the bus.
Even a normal oscilloscope nowadays can catch error frames, given the baud rate.

That is because on a production system (automobile or such), the bus
should not have bus-errors at all, and if it does (we live in the real
 world), then that's a problem we can't influence with software
(except for disabling CAN).
Of course, during develpment I see more problems, but
I make much more mistakes. That's when debugging was invented.

When a single (or few) bus-error is encountered, then you can/should
ignore it.
When a bunch of bus-errors is encountered, the chip will go into
error-passive(I tend to confuse the names :-) ) and in bus-off.
This triggers a bus-state change, which is interesting to alert an
application that things are getting bad.
so, on embedded device, I would never activate the bus-error interrupts. My
software is capable of dealing with CAN bus status as a binary value: 
&quot;it's gone&quot; or &quot;it's not gone&quot;
Anything in between is a test facility, and not production level.

I see some uses on a laptop. Then, you could investigate CAN bus quality
on a real machine/CAN bus. So, enable/disable globally is good enough. I my
system gets loaded in that situation, yep, so be it. I don't do that
every week :-). I only need it when I didn't bring the oscilloscope.

That's my opinion.
