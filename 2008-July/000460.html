</I>
I'd say, limited to that. Everything that's beyond standards should not
be exported to userspace. The driver might use it internally in a
sensible way.

&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> All the IXXAT based projects we have done so far work very well with
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that scheme. In the end, it was *invented* after we had problems with
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the former scheme not fulfilling all their stack requirements.
</I>&gt;<i> Exporting all possibilities that are beyond CAN2.0B, are responsibility of the driver.
</I>
I advise against it. Let's have a look at the SJA1000 SAM bit as an
example. The datasheet recommends setting that bit for &quot;low/medium speed
busses&quot; and clearing it for &quot;high speed busses&quot;. So the driver could
define a limit and set the bit accordingly. No need to export it.

If you exported it, _every_ general purpose userspace software would
have to check if the controller is a SJA1000 and then set/clear the bit
itself. And you'd need similar procedures for _all_ special features of
_all_ chips. To make it very clear, it really doesn't matter if you
stick the label &quot;expert mode&quot; to it. There is no such thing, only _one_
socketcan interface.

&gt;<i> I see here an opportunity to export one extra attribute, ie, the chip that is used
</I>&gt;<i> internally, or the driver that supports it.
</I>&gt;<i> Do we all agree that for 'normal' operation, a scheme with bitrate, brp, sjw, ... fits the needs?
</I>&gt;<i> From there, every driver exports its own extra attributes to provide _everything_ else?
</I>
No, as I explained above. Extra chip features could be used if we find a
generic way to export some kind of &quot;can_capabilities&quot; attribute. The
WLAN interface does similar things, e.g. you can find out if your chip
supports monitor mode in a generic way.

To use the above example, instead of exporting the chip specific SAM
bit, there could be a capability flag HAS_SPECIAL_LOWSPEED_TREATMENT. If
this flag is set, a userspace application can offer a &quot;low speed&quot;
setting and the driver will export a can_low_speed attribute that can be
set to 0 or 1.

The available capabilities would be documented so that userspace apps
could still be completely generic and would not have to care about what
chip is in there. Of course, drivers would be required to set all these
things to sensible default values (like WLAN drivers, which disable
monitor mode by default).

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It still poses a problem that probably, complex sysfs attributes are created.
</I>
No way. If we came up with such a crappy interface, the netdev people
would probably (after they finished using their brown paper bags) blow
our drivers to hell.

Thanks,
Hans
