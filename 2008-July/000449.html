Not necessarily inside the driver, but in the kernel.

Letting the user select the bitrate on the commandline with

	canconfig can0 125000

is easy to remember. He may have invented what 125000 means before and
has configured his /etc/network/interfaces correctly, but in the moment
of changing he just has to use this line.

You surely can also do

	echo $phase_seg1 &gt; /sys/bla/blub

for all the values in this moment, but it is error prone, many steps and
counter intuitive. Such a table in the kernel is cheap and we should
make it easy for the user to express simple things like &quot;use 125000
kbit&quot; in an easy and intuitive way.

Imagine you would be sitting in front of some random hardware *now*:
would you have the CiA values in your mind? I don't. I'm a lazy bastard.
I just want to say &quot;canconfig can0 125000&quot;.

&gt;<i> I need to have the tables in the userspace anyway (for the setup). And

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This can all be hidden easily behind some &quot;canconfig can0 bitrate
</I>&gt;<i> 125000&quot; script.
</I>
It's all a matter of convenience. And I think *this* little bit of
convenience can be expected from a world domination kernel :-)

It's also easier for C applications. They don't have to care about
calling canconfig with system() or have to deal with all that values;
usually, an application wants to be independend from the bit time
details. Most of our customers just know that their app runs at 250 kBit
or 125 kBit, and that can easily be coded into the application. With the
table, bit timing details are *config time issues*, and that's exactly
what they are.

You can surely make a convenience library, but that sounds very
arbitrary to me, and setting the bit time would be it's only task.
