</I>
Yep. But we should also have the /sys/bla/blub stuff to satisfy the
&quot;experts&quot;. It doesn't have to be atomic because we have to shutdown the
interface anyway. So it can be simple and clean one-value-per-file sysfs
attributes. Completely hardware independent. It's the drivers task to
sort it out correctly.

</I>&gt;<i> I just want to say &quot;canconfig can0 125000&quot;.
</I>
I second that.

&gt;<i> &gt; I need to have the tables in the userspace anyway (for the setup). And
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; it's no magic to create some scripts, that push the new value-set in one

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This can all be hidden easily behind some &quot;canconfig can0 bitrate
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 125000&quot; script.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It's all a matter of convenience. And I think *this* little bit of
</I>&gt;<i> convenience can be expected from a world domination kernel :-)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It's also easier for C applications. They don't have to care about

</I>&gt;<i> usually, an application wants to be independend from the bit time

</I>&gt;<i> or 125 kBit, and that can easily be coded into the application. With the
</I>&gt;<i> table, bit timing details are *config time issues*, and that's exactly
</I>&gt;<i> what they are.
</I>
Well, if it's just an application internally used in one project by one
customer, you're right. But people like the ixxat guys who write generic
CAN software

1) have to support _everything_ that is possible and might be needed,
2) should be able to do this in a hardware-independent way

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> You can surely make a convenience library, but that sounds very
</I>&gt;<i> arbitrary to me, and setting the bit time would be it's only task.
</I>
Yes, it would be a small lib, because it's essentially just a table
that's needed. It's nice if this table is a text file that can simply be
edited by the user, as Vladislav suggested.

Putting it all together, we have an international standard about CAN bit
timings for different bit timings. If every device could completely
fulfill this standard for all bitrates, and if every hardware
manufacturer followed this standard, we wouldn't have any discussion.

In practice, a CAN chip has an input clock frequency. It can derive a
certain amount of discrete time quantas from that clock by dividing it by an
integer between divider_min and divider_max. Furthermore, one bit time
can consist of time_quanta_min_count to time_quanta_max_count time
quantas.

If a driver provided this information (and only the driver can do this,
as it is completely hardware dependent), userspace &quot;expert&quot; tools could
easily determine what is possible with this hardware. With that, it
would be easy to provide a user with a legal set of /sys/bla/blub
settings that are possible for e.g. a certain bitrate.

Thanks,
Hans
