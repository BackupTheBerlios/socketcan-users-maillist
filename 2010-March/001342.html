</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Hi,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I played a little with various ways to manipulate tx/rxqueuesizes with SocketCAN.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I ended up with some questions:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 1) Does setsockopt(... ,SOL_SOCKET, SO_SNDBUF, ....) have any impact on CAN_RAW sockets?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; My result: no!
</I>&gt;<i> I _think_ that SO_SNDBUF sets the tx queue of the socket, not the
</I>&gt;<i> net_device. CAN_RAW sockets however do queue directly into the
</I>&gt;<i> net_device. So, I think a more precise answer would be &quot;yes, but you
</I>&gt;<i> never use it&quot;.
</I>When going through this thread, I think you are right and things become clearer.
&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 2) Does setsockopt(... ,SOL_SOCKET, SO_RCVBUF, ....) have any impact on CAN_RAW sockets?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Yes, that's also used by candump to prevent losing rx frames.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 1+2 brings me to the conclusion that setsockopt(..., SO_RCVBUF, ...) configures receive
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; behavior and &quot;ip link set can0 txqueuelen &lt;whatever&gt;&quot; configures tx behavior. Did I miss 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; anything?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 3) Do we have a way to make write() on CAN_RAW sockets block when there is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; no more buffer space? Typical behavior is returning ENOBUFS. I haven't tried to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; use select() for sending. Does this work?
</I>&gt;<i> poll() and select() would not work, since ENOBUFS comes from the
</I>&gt;<i> net_device. I have struggled with the ENOBUFS too.
</I>&gt;<i> Try to look at it this way: poll()/select() only work well if you know
</I>&gt;<i> you're the _only_ user using the file (reason: if more users use the same fd,
</I>&gt;<i> user A can write between B's calls to poll() &amp; write()).
</I>This really makes poll/select unusable. I really like the idea (of the esd 
CAN driver) that multiple applications can use/share one CAN interface without
really interfering. Up to now I was not really aware of SocketCAN's shared
txqueue.
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> You can be the only user of the socket, but not the only user of the
</I>&gt;<i> net_device.
</I>&gt;<i> This does in no way address you question. I just try to explain some
</I>&gt;<i> phenomena that took some time for me to understand properly.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 4) Do we have a way to flush the txqueue and block until all messages are on the bus?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; fsync() does not seem to be the right choice.
</I>&gt;<i> You mean: flush the socket's queue, not the netdev's queue (the latter
</I>&gt;<i> is shared)?
</I>Well, since SocketCAN does not use the socket's queue for sending i mean the latter.
But with a shared queue it could take forever when an other process keeps it filled.

&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 5) Is there any special reason why read/write can only handle single messages?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Is it just because nobody asked? It should be possible with our
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; fixed size stuct can_frame. It could even speed thing up.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Matthias
</I>&gt;<i> Each single point you raise is IMO an issue that can be improved. (maybe
</I>For now I am already glad to have to current implementation &quot;documented&quot;.
The current implementation is simple and keeps some ballast out of SocketCAN.

&gt;<i> 3. is really difficult to provide system-wide).
</I>&gt;<i> This would imply a serious modification in CAN_RAW:
</I>&gt;<i> * use socket's own queueing when net_device ENOBUFS
</I>This would be cool and will allow using poll/select with expected behavior.

&gt;<i> * hrtimer() based wakeup to retry flush the socket's queue
</I>&gt;<i> * trigger waitqueue when own message is received.
</I>&gt;<i> * big thing: on bus-off, everything must be dropped, errors sent, ...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Right?
